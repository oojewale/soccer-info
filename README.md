# Soccer Info
Wanted to refresh my memory of Python, so I decided to consume some API endpoints on the [ApiFootball API](https://apifootball.com/documentation) with Flask.

## Endpoints
* Standings -  Shows League standings.
* Teams -  Shows teams in a league with some extra info.

 Both endpoints accept a `league_id` param. Default is EPL.

## League Codes
League IDs of Europe's top 5 leagues:

* EPL: 148
* La Liga: 468
* Serie A: 262
* Ligue 1: 176
* Bundesliga: 195
